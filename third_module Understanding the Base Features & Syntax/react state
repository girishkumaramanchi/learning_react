state can only be used in extend component classes.

React can only re-render using 2 ways 1. state 2. props

component state if we update state using setState it will only update the one we want to update
But
functional state will override the old value with the new one we want to update
Therefore
we need to fill all the data so that we won't miss any of the data we may nned to use in the future.
