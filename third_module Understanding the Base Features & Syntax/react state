state is the most important react hook

state can only be used in extend component classes.

React can only re-render using 2 ways 1. state 2. props

component state if we update state using setState it will only update the one we want to update
But
functional state will override the old value with the new one we want to update
Therefore
we need to fill all the data so that we won't miss any of the data we may nned to use in the future.

In functional state we will use multiple useState to store individual variables.
we call it multiple separated state slices

const [ personsState, updatedPersonsState] = useState(
      {
        persons: [
          { name:"Tatsuya", age:18 },
          { name:"Miyuki", age:17 },
          { name:"Lina", age:17 },
          { name:"X", age:undefined }
        ],
        // otherState: "some other value"
      }
    );

const [ otherState, updatedOtherState] = useState("some other value");

const App = props => {} this is functional 

class App extends Component {} this is component state

stateless - dumb - presentational components which are not having own state use as many as possible

stateful - smart - container - class based component - component state, functional state having state use few of these component in the project is a good thing.
