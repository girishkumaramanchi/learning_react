Components are the basic building blocks.

we can split the page into different components.

constructor   Call super(props)   can setup state  don't cause side effects such as http requests

getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)    sync state     don't cause side effects such as http requests

render()  prepare & structure your JSX code

renderChildComponents

componentDidMount()    don't cause side effects such as http requests   don't setup state  because it will re-render the components
